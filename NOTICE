English Dictionary
============================================================
2006-02-07 release.

This dictionary is based on a subset of the original English wordlist created
by Kevin Atkinson for Pspell and  Aspell and thus is covered by his original
LGPL license.  The affix file is a heavily modified version of the original
english.aff file which was released as part of Geoff Kuenning's Ispell and as
such is covered by his BSD license.

Thanks to both authors for their wonderful work.
